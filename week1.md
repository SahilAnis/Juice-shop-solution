Cybersecurity Intern Project: Strengthening Security Measures for a Web Application
Overview
This project introduces interns to fundamental cybersecurity concepts. Over three weeks, you'll analyze a simple User Management System for vulnerabilities, implement security measures, and perform basic penetration testing. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating web application security risks.

Week 1: Security Assessment
Objective
Familiarize yourself with the application and identify vulnerabilities using basic tools and techniques.

Steps:
Set Up the Application

Clone a simple mock web application from GitHub:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd user-management-system
npm install
npm start
Explore the app at http://localhost:3000. Test pages like:
Signup
Login
Profile
Perform a Vulnerability Assessment

Use these tools to identify common vulnerabilities:
OWASP ZAP: Scan for automated web app vulnerabilities.
Browser Developer Tools: Test for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) with:
html
Copy
Edit
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
SQL Injection Test: Try injecting admin' OR '1'='1 in the login fields.
Focus on:
Input fields for XSS vulnerabilities.
Weak password storage mechanisms.
Misconfigurations in the application.
Deliverables

Create a document listing:
Vulnerabilities found.
Suggestions for improvement.
