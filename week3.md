Week 3: Advanced Security and Final Reporting
Objective
Perform advanced security checks, set up logging, and summarize your findings in a final report.

Steps:
Penetration Testing

Use tools like:
Nmap: Simulate attacks and identify open ports.
Browser-based tools for manual vulnerability testing.
Test scenarios:
Brute force login attempts.
Directory traversal attacks.
Logging for Security Monitoring

Install and configure winston for logging:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install winston
Example logging setup:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const winston = require('winston');
const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'security.log' })
  ]
});
logger.info('Application started');
Security Best Practices Checklist

Validate all inputs.
Enforce HTTPS for secure data transmission.
